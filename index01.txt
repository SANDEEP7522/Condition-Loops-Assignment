In JavaScript, conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are true or false. The most common conditional statements in JavaScript are:

if statement: It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // code block to execute if condition is true
}
Example:
let x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
}
if-else statement: It executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.
Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // code block to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code block to execute if condition is false
}
Example:
let x = 3;
if (x % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("x is even");
} else {
    console.log("x is odd");
}
if-else if-else statement: It allows checking multiple conditions and executing different blocks of code based on the first condition that is true.
Syntax:
if (condition1) {
    // code block to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code block to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    // code block to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
Example:
let x = 0;
if (x > 0) {
    console.log("x is positive");
} else if (x < 0) {
    console.log("x is negative");
} else {
    console.log("x is zero");
}
These conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to create dynamic and responsive scripts that can handle different scenarios based on conditions.
